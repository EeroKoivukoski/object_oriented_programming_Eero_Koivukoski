First we count how many of each age there are in our class. Then calculate how many procent each agegroup is of the
class as a whole. Then make a two dimensional array with certain groups of numbers (out of a hundred) per age group.
This works as a procentage chance to get the certain age. then just use random to get a random number out of a hundred.

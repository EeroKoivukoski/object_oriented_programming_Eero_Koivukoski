    Directly observable variables:
    A = amount of passangers arriving to the bus stop
    C = amount of passangers ending their ride
    B = amount of time the bus spends carrying passangers
    T = one day of operations

    Derived variables:
    U = B/T amount of time the bus is in use
    X = C/T how many passangers were served
    S = B/C average duration of rides

    Additional directly observable variables:
    R𝑖 = response time or time from arrival on stop to drop off
    W =  total response time for all passangers

    Further derived:
    R = W/C avg passanger response time
    N = W/T avg amount of passanges waiting or riding on the bus
